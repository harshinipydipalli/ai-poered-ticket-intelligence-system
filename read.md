‚úÖ What is ITSM?
ITSM stands for Information Technology Service Management ‚Äî not Infrastructure.

üí° Definition:
ITSM is the process-based approach to designing, delivering, managing, and improving the way IT services are used within an organization.

## üìå Examples of core (frequently used) ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) in Action, these are part of ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) 
frame work
| Situation                     | ITSM Process                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Employee can't log in         | **Incident Management**         |
| A new employee joins          | **Service Request Fulfillment** |
| Email system will be upgraded | **Change Management**           |
| Network is slow               | **Problem Management**          |
| SLA breaches                  | **Service Level Management**    |
Incident Management and change management are universal tech companies lean  mostly towards agile, cloud nativ and devops driven environments
the above itsm processes are mostly used in industries like retail, banking, telecom, enterprise , it support

## üîç Company-Specific Practices
| **Company** | **Key Traits**                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google**  | Invented **SRE**. Uses SLIs/SLOs, automated incident tracking, runbooks, blameless postmortems.               |
| **Amazon**  | Focus on **operational excellence**. Uses ticketing + automation + runbooks in a hybrid model.                |
| **Netflix** | Heavy **chaos engineering**, very cloud-native. Change is frequent; rollback is fast.                         |
| **Myntra**  | E-commerce focus. Uses a mix of ITSM + Agile/DevOps; incident response is time-critical during sales seasons. |
| **Zipcar**  | (If referring to Zipcar: mobility company) likely integrates ITSM with fleet & mobility systems.              |
| **Airbnb**  | DevOps-heavy, high focus on observability and reliability in a service-oriented architecture.                 |

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Modern Tools They Use
| **Area**             | **Tools**                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Incident Mgmt        | PagerDuty, Opsgenie, FireHydrant        |
| Change Mgmt (DevOps) | GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Spinnaker      |
| Monitoring/SLIs      | Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana, New Relic |
| Communication        | Slack, Jira, Confluence, StatusPage     |

Yes ‚Äî while Incident, Change, Problem, Service Request, and Service Level Management are the most commonly mentioned ITSM processes, the full ITSM framework (especially under ITIL 4) includes many more processes (or ‚Äúpractices‚Äù) that support service delivery, reliability, and continuous improvement.

Here‚Äôs a more complete breakdown of key ITSM processes grouped by category:

üß© Core ITSM Processes Beyond the Basics

### ‚úÖ Service Management Practices
| **Process**                      | **Purpose**                                                             | **Example**                                                                
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service Catalog Management**   | Ensures accurate, up-to-date service offerings are available to users.  | An internal Myntra portal lists "Request VPN Access", "New Laptop", or 
                                                                                                               "Request Software License".   |
| **Availability Management**      | Ensures services are available as agreed (99.9% uptime, etc.).          | Netflix ensures its video streaming service maintains 99.99% uptime using 
                                                                                                               SLAs and SRE teams.        |
| **Capacity & Performance Mgmt**  | Ensures infrastructure can meet demand without degradation.             | Amazon auto-scales servers during Prime Day to handle traffic spikes and 
                                                                                                                avoid slowdowns.            |
| **IT Asset Management**          | Tracks IT assets throughout their lifecycle.                            | Google uses an internal system to track employee laptops, licenses, and                                                                                                                   phones from issue to return. |
| **Service Configuration Mgmt**   | Maintains info about infrastructure, apps, relationships (CMDB).        | Airbnb tracks which microservices run on which servers via a central                                                                                                                      Configuration Management DB.    |
| **Release Management**           | Plans and controls service releases and deployments.                    | Myntra plans major feature releases like personalized product pages ahead                                                                                                                 of Diwali sales.           |
| **Deployment Management**        | Actually deploys code/releases into environments.                       | Netflix pushes new code via Spinnaker using blue-green deployment to avoid                                                                                                                service disruption.       |
| **Service Continuity Mgmt**      | Ensures IT services can recover from major incidents (DR/BCP planning). | Google ensures Gmail can fail over to a secondary data center within                                                                                                                      seconds if the primary fails.   |
| **Monitoring & Event Mgmt**      | Detects performance issues and alerts the team in real-time.            | Amazon CloudWatch sends alerts to Opsgenie when CPU usage exceeds a                                                                                                                       threshold in AWS EC2 instances.  |
| **Service Validation & Testing** | Validates services before going live.                                   | Netflix runs automated integration tests for recommendation engine updates                                                                                                                before deployment.        |


### üîß Technical Management Practices
| **Process**                        | **Purpose**                                          | **Example**                                                                                 
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Infrastructure & Platform Mgmt** | Manages underlying infra (cloud, on-prem).           | Amazon Web Services (AWS) manages its cloud infrastructure using tools like CloudFormation                                                                                                and EC2 autoscaling to maintain platform reliability and efficiency. |
| **Software Development & Mgmt**    | Covers lifecycle of custom or in-house applications. | Google develops and maintains internal tools like Google Meet, managing their full SDLC                                                                                                   (design, dev, test, deploy) using CI/CD pipelines and version control.  |


### üîÅ General Management Practices
| **Process**                   | **Purpose**                                                              | **Example**                                                                  
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continual Improvement**     | Drives ongoing service optimization.                                     | Netflix uses user feedback and metrics to constantly refine its UI and                                                                                                                     recommendation algorithms.                               |
| **Information Security Mgmt** | Protects data and systems. Often integrated with cybersecurity.          | Amazon implements strict IAM policies and encryption protocols across AWS to                                                                                                               secure data and services.                          |
| **Risk Management**           | Identifies and mitigates risks in IT services.                           | Google assesses risks like data center outages and mitigates them through                                                                                                                 redundancy and simulations.                           |
| **Supplier Management**       | Manages vendors, contracts, and third-party SLAs.                        | Myntra manages contracts with delivery partners like Delhivery and ensures                                                                                                                 SLAs (e.g., delivery within 2 days) are met.         |
| **Workforce & Talent Mgmt**   | Ensures staff with right skills are available.                           | Netflix‚Äôs culture deck emphasizes hiring top talent and maintaining a high-                                                                                                               performance culture through continuous upskilling.   |
| **Knowledge Management**      | Captures and shares organizational knowledge (FAQs, wikis, KB articles). | Zipcar maintains internal Confluence spaces and FAQs for onboarding and                                                                                                                   troubleshooting support team queries.                   |
| **Project Management**        | Coordinates IT projects for timely delivery.                             | Amazon uses Agile/Scrum to manage large-scale Prime infrastructure upgrades                                                                                                               for peak sale events.                               |
| **Change Enablement**         | Formerly "Change Mgmt"; now more agile and iterative.                    | Google enables weekly feature rollouts using feature flags and A/B testing                                                                                                                 to safely manage change in Gmail or Search features. |
